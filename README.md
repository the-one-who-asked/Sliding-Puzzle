# Sliding-Puzzle
A simple, small game written in python. It's a combination game that challenges the player to slide pieces along certain routes in order to get them in the right order. The player can choose the board size by enterring a number at the start, with 3 being at easy difficulty, 4 at medium,  5 at hard and 7 at expert. Of course, the player can choose higher, difficulties, lower difficulties or anything in between. Note that most laptops won't be capable of displaying any size larger than 9.

You can also **click on a piece** to slide all pieces between that piece and the empty square onto the empty square.

Arrow key while holding **shift**: Slide an entire row, from the direction of the arrow you've chosen, onto the empty square
